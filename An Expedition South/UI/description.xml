Mora is a god no more - The Sundbridge Shrine was cleansed of the twilight's curse and Mora's minions have been defeated. But the star trapped in the heart of the earth, which the shrine connected to its brother in the boundless void, had already been tainted with the curse of twilight. The worst outgrowth of this new infestation has affected a fire tribe in a distant land in the south, a tribe that worships the molten core and it was not long before the curse spread beyond the tribe's members and plunged the whole land into darkness. Despite the fact that they themselves had just rid their own lands from this very curse, a group of brave lyrish volunteers undertook an expedition south to nip this new outbreak in the bud.
